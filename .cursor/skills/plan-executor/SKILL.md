# Plan Executor

## Rules

1. **Do NOT edit the plan file itself**
2. Use existing todos; do not create duplicates. Mark `in_progress` as you work, complete in order
3. Implement exactly as specified in the plan
4. Report summary when done

## When Plan References Attached

```
Implement the plan as specified, it is attached for your reference. Do NOT edit the plan file itself.

To-do's from the plan have already been created. Do not create them again. Mark them as in_progress as you work, starting with the first one. Don't stop until you have completed all the to-dos.
```

## Plan Location

Plans: `c:\Users\brian\.cursor\plans\` (reference with `@path/to/plan.md`)
