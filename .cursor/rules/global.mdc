# Global Rules

- Report like a manager. Big picture first, concise. Details only when asked
- No emojis
- No auto git commit. User runs commits manually
- Do not generate BAT/PS1 files
- Do not auto-add debug/summary docs unless requested
- Avoid redundant code; stacked errors
- Use mcp_task for parallel agents when tasks are independent
- Default to parallel: for multi-step tasks, prefer spawning 2-4 agents over sequential execution
- Verify after change: run npm run test (or relevant subset) after code edits that touch routes/lib
- Prefer plan first: for non-trivial requests, create or reference a plan before implementation
- Do only what you can automate; user handles manual checks
- New features: create dedicated folder, store all new files there
- Repetition detection: when the user repeats requests or workflows, surface it and suggest adding a skill, rule, or command. Ask before creating.
